## About Folder

I saw a photo showing different programming exercises that programmers should be able to do after their first semester in university and I wanted to share my solutions to them. This could also serve as somewhat of a final self-assessment or something similar to anyone who is in the Programming 1 Class of A.Y. 2022 - 2023 in Universidad De Dagupan.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
